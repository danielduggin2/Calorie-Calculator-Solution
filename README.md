# Calorie Counter Web Application

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

## Project Overview

In this practice project, you'll learn the following key concepts:

- Basic regular expressions for validating user input.
- Utilizing template literals for dynamic content generation.
- Implementing the `addEventListener()` method to handle user interactions.
- Performing calculations based on user input to calculate calorie consumption.
- Dynamically updating the user interface to display the calculated results.

## Key Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, you'll learn and apply the following fundamental concepts:

- Understanding and applying regular expressions to validate user input.
- Using template literals to generate dynamic content and display information.
- Implementing event listeners to capture user input and trigger appropriate actions.
- Performing calculations based on user input to determine calorie consumption.
- Dynamically updating the user interface to reflect the calculated results.
